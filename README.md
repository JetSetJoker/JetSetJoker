Hello! I'm @JetSetJoker, and I make video games, from 2D pixel to 3D with AAA graphics! I make games as a hobby; I like the challenge of making clean code.

Since this isn't a job for me, I can make games at my pace with passion, and so far they have all been free!
I try to make my methods transparent as well; If my game will send data, it will let you know, every time, with source code to back up that promise.
